**HealthAI** is a sophisticated machine learning application designed to assess lung cancer risk factors through comprehensive health questionnaires. Built with advanced neural networks and deployed as a beautiful, responsive web application, it provides both healthcare professionals and individuals with valuable insights into lung cancer risk assessment.

> ⚠️ **Medical Disclaimer**: This tool is for educational and informational purposes only. It is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with qualified healthcare providers.

## 🌟 Why HealthAI Matters

### 📈 **The Global Lung Cancer Crisis**

Lung cancer remains one of the most devastating diseases worldwide, but early detection can save lives:

- **🔴 2.2 Million** new cases diagnosed globally each year
- **💔 1.8 Million** deaths annually - more than breast, prostate, and colon cancers combined
- **⏰ 5-Year Survival Rate**: Only **18%** overall, but **56%** when caught early
- **💰 $21 Billion** spent annually on lung cancer treatment in the US alone
- **🚬 85%** of cases are preventable through lifestyle changes and early intervention

### 🎯 **The Problem We're Solving**

**Healthcare Accessibility Gap**
- Many communities lack access to specialized oncology screening
- Traditional risk assessment requires expensive medical consultations
- Rural and underserved populations have limited healthcare resources
- Early-stage lung cancer often presents no symptoms

**Current Screening Limitations**
- CT scans are expensive ($300-$1,000 per scan)
- Limited to high-risk patients (heavy smokers, age 50+)
- Requires specialized equipment and radiologists
- Many at-risk individuals never get screened

**Information Barrier**
- Patients don't understand their personal risk factors
- Complex medical terminology creates confusion
- Lack of personalized health recommendations
- No accessible tools for self-assessment
